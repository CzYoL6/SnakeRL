# SnakeRL
Play snake game with reinforcement learning. The client is made in Unreal Engine 5, and the RL part is written in python.

# How to Start
- Open the client project with Unreal Engine 5. 
- Run `python agent.py`.
- Launch the game within the UE editor.


# About this Project
- This is a test project of doing reinforcement learning in Unreal Engine. The RL algorithm chosen is DQN, and is hand written from scratch. Maybe use OpenAI Gym and StableBaseline3 in the future.
- The client and the agent are connected through TCP on port 65290.
- Tested in Unreal Engine 5.1, and python 3.11.
